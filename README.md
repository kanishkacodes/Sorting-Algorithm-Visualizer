The project is focused on visualizing sorting algorithms.
Sorting algorithms are used to sort a collection of items into a specific order.
The project provides a visual representation of the sorting process in real-time, allowing users to see how the algorithm works step-by-step.
The user can input a list of items to be sorted, and the visualization will show how the algorithm sorts the items.
The project supports multiple sorting algorithms, including bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort.
The user can select which algorithm to use and adjust the speed of the visualization.
The visualization shows the progress of the algorithm by highlighting the items being compared and swapped.
The project also provides a summary of the number of comparisons and swaps made by the algorithm.
The user can pause, resume, or restart the visualization at any time.
The project is intended to help users understand how sorting algorithms work and how they can be used to solve problems in computer science and other fields.
